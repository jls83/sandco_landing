## About Me
I'm a __Software Engineer__ based in the NYC Metro Area (specifically [Lynbrook, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynbrook,_New_York)).

I love working in Python, and have warmed up  to JavaScript. I also have experience with C++, C#, Clojure, Powershell, and Rust. Vim is my editor of choice, though lately I have been using the wonderful IdeaVim plugin for PyCharm/WebStorm.

In my free time I am a musician, playing guitar and bass for various bands. Check out some of them below!

* [Rice Cultivation Society](https://ricecultivationsociety.bandcamp.com/) _(inactive)_
* [Sick Sticks](http://sicksticksband.com/)
