## About Me
I'm a __Software Engineer__ based in the NYC Metro Area (specifically [Lynbrook, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynbrook,_New_York)).

This is a test paragraph to be removed.

I love working in Python, and lately (thanks to ES6) have warmed up to working in JavaScript. I also have experience with C++, C#, Clojure/Clojurescript, Powershell, and Rust. Vim is my editor of choice, though lately I have been using the wonderful IdeaVim plugin for PyCharm/WebStorm. I can currently be found discussing Git rebasing and branch naming strategies with anyone who will listen.

In my free time I am a musician, playing guitar and bass for various bands. Check out some of them below!
